            <p>You are opening up your home to a homeless animal that will know nothing but love for the remainder of their lives.</p>
            <p> Many of our animals were picked up as strays off the streets or abandoned in our parking lot. You will show the animal (or animals) that you adopt that they can trust humans again. 
            <br>They will never go hungry or be hurt. You can forever change the life of an animal that you bring into your home!</p>

            <p>When you choose to adopt an animal over paying expensive breeders, you are freeing up space for us to help even more animals in need!
                <br>Backyard breeders don't care about ensuring their pets are not inbred. So-called "purebred" dogs, are very likely to be inbred and will have various health issues pop up over time.
                <br>Certain diseases and disabilities are literally bred into "purebred" dogs. Hip dysplasia in German Shepherds and the fact that English Bulldogs cannot naturally mate and breed without medical intervention is due to decades of inbreeding. Many dogs that were bred by backyard breeders end up in the parking lot of our shelter, dumped as unsold stock from these breeders.</p>
