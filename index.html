        <h3>Mission Statement</h3>

        <p>Our shelter began with the adoption of an adult cat named Baby from an animal shelter in Lemoore, CA. A year later, Diva joined our little family, and from that point on, our founder, Robin Guyton, has dedicated her life to the rescue of animals. (These cats are not Baby or Diva, they are adoptable!)</p>

        <h3>Personal Goals in the Fight for Animals</h3>

        <p>I am Robin Guyton, the owner of Baby and Div's Animal Shelter. My life's goal is to see every local animal shelter become completely empty, meaning that all of its animals are in loving homes. I'd like to see every homeless cat and dog on the street find a warm home with plenty of food.</p>

        <p> We are here to see the end of suffering for all animals, and you can help us by adopting an animal from our shelter, or even volunteering. If you are a servicemember and choose to volunteer, we keep in constant contact with NAS Lemoore leadership to track your volunteer hours!</p>
